## 👋 Hey there! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5679180/79618120-0daffb80-80be-11ea-819e-d2b0fa904d07.gif" width="30px" alt="Wave"> 

<h2 align="center">I'm Martin, a 17-year-old tech enthusiast from Poing, Germany!</h2>

### 🌟 About Me

I'm currently a student at the **vocational high school (Fachoberschule)** in Erding, where I'm diving into my passion for **programming** and exploring new challenges. When I'm not coding, you can find me:

- 🎹 Playing the piano with heart and soul
- 🏃‍♂️ Competing in track and field (athletics)
- 🚴‍♂️ Exploring the outdoors on my bike

### 💻 What I'm Working On

🔒 **msg** - A personal project focused on **encrypting text messages** to keep communication secure. It's not open source, but it's **free to use**!  
Check out the repository here: [github.com/cracky22/msg_encrypt](https://github.com/cracky22/msg_encrypt)
